			I'm Washington born and raised, but have always done my best to broaden my horizons and understand the world around me. My goal as a web developer is to constantly stay on the path to improvement both for myself and my projects. I thrive on consistently learning new skills, building new projects, and working to repair issues both known and unknown.
